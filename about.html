    <h2>About IT Career Map</h2>
        <p>Within an IT Department, we have a great many titles and for individual contributors, especially early in their career, it is in no way easy to understand how to move through a career in IT and whether it is possible to become qualified for a particular job without having to pass through other jobs and experiences first.  The IT career map is a combination of visualizations and algorithmic computations that is intended to develop a roadmap and set of recommendations that anyone in IT can use to help find their way from one job and into another.</p>
